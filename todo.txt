  Critical Issues

  3. Security Concerns
  - No input sanitization for SQL injection in custom queries
  - Plugin system allows arbitrary code execution without sandboxing
  - Missing rate limiting or connection management

  Important Improvements Needed

  4. Documentation
  - Missing API documentation generation
  - No migration guides for schema changes
  - Plugin development docs incomplete

  5. Error Handling
  - Database connection failures not gracefully handled in src/database.ts:36
  - Missing transaction rollback error recovery
  - Plugin timeout handling needs improvement

  6. Testing
  - Good test coverage (17 test files) but missing:
    - Edge case testing for constraint violations
    - Multi-threaded/concurrent access tests
    - Plugin system integration tests
    - Performance regression tests

  7. Production Readiness
  - No logging/monitoring capabilities
  - Missing health check endpoints
  - No graceful shutdown handling
  - Memory usage monitoring absent

  Recommended Actions

  1. Add build system: TypeScript compilation, bundling, declaration files
  2. Security audit: Input validation, SQL injection prevention
  3. Connection pooling: For production database loads
  4. Logging framework: Structured logging for debugging
  5. Performance monitoring: Query timing, memory usage
  6. Documentation: Auto-generated API docs
  7. CI/CD: Automated testing, security scanning
