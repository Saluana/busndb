Critical Issues

  - Lazy initialization is not implemented (empty `initializeLazy` method in `src/database.ts`).
  - Synchronous methods (`closeSync`, `execSync`, `querySync`) don't fully support the plugin system in `src/database.ts`.
  - Add a comment to explain dynamic import of Bun driver in `src/database.ts`.
  - Potential unhandled promise rejection in `executeHookWithTimeout` method in `src/plugin-system.ts`.
  - Plugin hook registration in `src/plugin-system.ts` might not be robust enough to find all hook methods.

Important Improvements Needed

  - Bulk operations (`insertBulk`, `putBulk`, `deleteBulk`) in `src/collection.ts` are inefficient and should be optimized.
  - The `validateFieldName` method in `src/collection.ts` might not validate all field names, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
  - Synchronous methods in `src/collection.ts` don't fully support the plugin system.
