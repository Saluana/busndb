Critical Issues

  - Potential unhandled promise rejection in `executeHookWithTimeout` method in `src/plugin-system.ts`.
  - Plugin hook registration in `src/plugin-system.ts` might not be robust enough to find all hook methods.

Important Improvements Needed

  - Bulk operations (`insertBulk`, `putBulk`, `deleteBulk`) in `src/collection.ts` are inefficient and should be optimized.
  - The `validateFieldName` method in `src/collection.ts` might not validate all field names, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
  - Synchronous methods in `src/collection.ts` don't fully support the plugin system.
